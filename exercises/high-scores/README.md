# High Scores

Manage a game player's High Score list. 

The High Score list knows about the highest scores, the last added score and other info useful for a game player. 

In this exercise you're going to instantiate a class and add some instance methods. http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/writing_classes/initializers.html

A HighScore accepts an array with one or more numbers, each representing one 'game score'. The Array class can offer inspiration for working with arrays. https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Array.html
